## Hello everyone 👋
I'm in the middle of a **GitHub glow-up** as I transition into a new career path.

What I am learning:  
⭐ Python - data analysis, visualization, and basic ML   
⭐ SQL - data extraction, aggregation, and  analysis   
⭐ Tableau 


Over the next few weeks, I’ll be adding:  
🎄New projects  
🎁 Updated bio, skills & tools
