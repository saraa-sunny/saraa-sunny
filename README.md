Hi, I’m Sara.
<br>
I completed my MSc in Bioinformatics, began my career as a Python developer, and am now transitioning into Bioinformatics and Data Science.

I love building models and pipelines to understand genes, cells, and the brain.<br>

🔍What I’m into:
* Predicting disease onset 
* Improving patient outcomes 
* Supporting better disease diagnosis

I use *Python* and its libraries like *pandas*, *NumPy*, and *scikit-learn* to build ML models, and make them useful by creating interactive web apps on *Streamlit*.

✨Three things about me:
* I love solving puzzles.
* I think Sherlock Holmes is cool.
* I wish I had a mind-reading superpower,that would be fun!
