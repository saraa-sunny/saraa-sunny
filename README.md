Hi, Iâ€™m Sara.
<br>
I completed my MSc in Bioinformatics, began my career as a Python developer, and am now transitioning into Bioinformatics and Data Science.
<br><br>
I love building models and pipelines to understand genes, cells, and the brain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Three things about me:
* I love solving puzzles.
* I think Sherlock Holmes is cool.
* I wish I had a mind-reading superpower â€” that would be fun!
