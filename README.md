## Hello everyone 👋
I’m Cinta.
I’m a Data Analyst with 3 years of experience working with SQL and Python.  

I love analysing customer and business data to *understand what’s really happening* and turning those insights into **actionable business decisions**.

### 🔍 What I Do
  🔸 Analyze structured business data to uncover profitability, pricing, customer, and operational insights  
  🔸 Write advanced SQL queries to aggregate, segment, and diagnose performance issues  
  🔸 Use Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis  
  🔸 Build clear, decision-focused dashboards using PowerBI and Streamlit  
  🔸 Translate ambiguous stakeholder questions into measurable, data-backed recommendations. 


### 🛠️ Skills & Tools   
  🔹 Programming & Databases : Python, SQL, PostgreSQL   
  🔹 Data Analysis & Visualization : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, PowerBI(PowerQuery,DAX), Streamlit  
  🔹 Workflow & Tools : Git, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm

  🔸 [Coffee Sales PowerBI Dashboard](https://github.com/saraaxdata/coffee-sales-powerbi)

### ⭐️ How I Work
*I ask more whys than expected*.  
I like working backwards from business questions, breaking vague problems into clear metrics, and validating insights. I care more about **clarity and impact** than fancy models.
