## Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Saraa,
a Python developer learning data science by building projects.

I mostly work with Python, SQL, ML, and Streamlit to turn data into insights that create real impact in healthcare and biology.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me reading, drinking chai, or rewatching Studio Ghibli movies.
I also enjoy writing my thoughts and learnings on Medium.

Fun fact: ðŸŽ¬ Howlâ€™s Moving Castle is my comfort movie.
